# Hairline SVG direction

Use one detailed, interactive illustration at a time. Start from an existing wallet image and preserve its meaning.

The current example develops the wallet security section's **Audit log** image into four layered paper records. The folded corner, binding holes, ruled entries, and thin paper edges identify the object without words inside the drawing.

## Reference and engine

- [Hairline figures](https://hairline.lucasmarkes.com/figures)
- [Official creation skill](https://hairline.lucasmarkes.com/skill)
- [Upstream source](https://github.com/lucasmarkes/hairline)

Use the `hairline-create` skill. Its unchanged kernel supplies projection, springs, pointer handling, drawing primitives, and theme styles. Its unchanged bench supplies the review page. The source figure contains the wallet-specific geometry and interaction.

The kernel and bench use the MIT license. Keep `HAIRLINE-LICENSE.txt` beside the generated page.

## Drawing

- Use the engine's 400 × 320 coordinate system and isometric camera.
- Build recognizable objects from rounded outlines and specific physical details.
- Keep outer outlines stronger than internal rules and creases.
- Use opaque surfaces. Paint from back to front so nearer sheets cover farther sheets.
- Use the engine's stroke classes. Keep color, line weight, and theme behavior in the shared engine.
- Highlight one object. Transfer the outline highlight to the selected record.
- Keep words, numbers, arrows, and interface controls outside the SVG drawing.
- Compose a complete resting pose that remains recognizable at 240px.

Retain the wallet site's typography and spacing when integrating approved artwork. Keep the current example isolated on its review page until its appearance and movement are accepted.

## Audit log interaction

Moving horizontally separates the sheets. Each sheet moves around the stack's center, so the composition remains centered as it opens. Moving over an exposed sheet transfers the highlighted outline and updates the short record readout.

Pointer exit returns the stack to its resting spacing. The intensity slider controls the maximum separation. Its low, middle, and high values are 18, 26, and 34 world units.

The shared spring follows continuous pointer input. Its default stiffness is 100, damping is 18, and mass is 1. The engine stops its frame loop when the spring settles and respects the operating system's reduced-motion preference.

Hit testing uses the target position, from the front sheet to the back sheet. It excludes covered sheets and the cut corner. Testing a moving sheet's current position can cause unstable selection, so use the target geometry consistently.

The figure updates paths only when the sheet spacing changes. Theme and outline transitions come from the shared engine.

## Source and rebuild

The source image lives in `apps/wallet-console/src/components/h2/sections.tsx`, in `H2Security` under **Audit log**.

The replacement review page has these files:

- `apps/wallet-console/showcase/motion/audit-log.js` — editable figure.
- `apps/wallet-console/showcase/motion/index.html` — generated, self-contained page.
- `apps/wallet-console/showcase/motion/HAIRLINE-LICENSE.txt` — upstream license.

Edit only the figure when changing the artwork. Rebuild with the installed skill:

```sh
node "$HOME/.codex/skills/hairline-create/build.mjs" \
  apps/wallet-console/showcase/motion/audit-log.js \
  apps/wallet-console/showcase/motion/index.html
```

Do not format or manually edit the generated HTML. The validator checks that its kernel and bench remain unchanged.

The local review URL is `/dashboard-static/showcase/motion/`. The page contains one figure with intensity and theme controls.

## Visual verification

Run the skill's browser review after each figure change. From `.artifacts/audit-log`, run:

```sh
node "$HOME/.codex/skills/hairline-create/look.mjs" \
  ../../apps/wallet-console/showcase/motion/audit-log.js \
  --answer 245,170 --edge 310,160 --zoom answer
```

Inspect the contact sheet, the 240px views, and the motion sequence. Confirm all of these conditions:

- The folded paper and printed rows remain recognizable at 240px.
- Rest and expanded poses remain centered and inside the frame.
- Near sheets hide farther sheets throughout movement.
- Only the selected record has the highlighted outline.
- Pointer movement settles without flicker or repeated animation.
- The readout identifies the exposed record under the pointer.
- Both themes preserve the geometry and visual hierarchy.
- Slider extremes remain inside the frame.
- The browser console contains no errors or warnings.

The review script saves repeatable visual artifacts. Its automatic checks cover bounds, readout, console errors, and settling. Human visual review still determines whether the illustration feels right.

Before production integration, check keyboard access, reduced motion, and physical touch behavior in the host component. Keep essential explanations in adjacent HTML. Decorative motion must never determine wallet authentication, signing, or transaction state.
